# Vite Project Template - Vanilla JavaScript

A custom vanilla JS project template using Vite, pre-configured with ESLint, Prettier, and a clean folder structure for fast project setup.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository and install the necessary packages.
- I recommend using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) for cloning.

### Steps:

1. Install degit globally (only required once):
   ```
   npm install -g degit
   ```
2. Create a root directory for your project, navigate to it, and run the following command to clone the template:

   ```
   degit https://github.com/DarkstarXDD/vite-templates#vanilla-js
   ```

3. After cloning, install the project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
